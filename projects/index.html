                  to locate and sink each other's ships. Hits and misses are visually indicated, and the game continues until one side’s entire fleet 
                  is destroyed. The program makes use of JOptionPane for input and board display, providing a clean, interactive experience without

                  ship placement, promoting clarity and modular design. This project demonstrates key programming concepts such as loops, arrays, user

                  networks implemented in PyTorch. The task progresses through building and analyzing three model variations: a simple linear classifier, 
                  a single-hidden-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP), and an extended MLP that projects features into a two-dimensional latent space for 
                  visualization. Through this progression, the project demonstrates how increasing model capacity improves classification accuracy and 
                  enables clearer feature separation. Students learn to prepare datasets with dataloaders, train models using Adam optimization and 
                  cross-entropy loss, and evaluate performance using accuracy and loss metrics. The final visualization stage highlights how neural networks 
                  learn structured internal representations that make different Iris species more easily separable. All work is contained within a Jupyter 
                  notebook for clarity, experimentation, and reproducibility."

                  focuses on implementing core components of relational database theory, including functional dependency checking, attribute closure computation, 
                  projection, natural join, and BCNF decomposition. The program represents relations with attributes, tuples, and functional dependencies, and performs 
                  validation to detect BCNF violations. The project also includes logic to decompose non-BCNF schemas into lossless, dependency-preserving components, 
                  reinforcing fundamental concepts in relational schema normalization and database design."
